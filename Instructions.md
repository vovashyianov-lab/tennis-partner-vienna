# coding pattern preferences
-   Always prefer simple solutions
-   Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
-   You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
-   When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old iplementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic.
-   Keep the codebase very clean and organized
-   Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once
-   Avoid having files over 400-500 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
-   Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments
-   Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming


# Coding workflow preferences
-   Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
-   Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
-   Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly structed
-   Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
